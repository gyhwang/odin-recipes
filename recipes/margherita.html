    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Pizza Dough:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together 
            the all-purpose flour, sugar, yeast and salt. 
            Add the warm water and olive oil, and stir the mixture 
            with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together. 
            It will seem shaggy and dry, but don’t worry.</li> <br>
        <li>Scrape the dough onto a well-floured counter top and 
            knead the dough for three minutes. It should quickly come together 
            and begin to get sticky. Dust the dough with flour as needed 
            (sometimes I will have to do this 2 to 3 times, depending on 
            humidity levels) – it should be slightly tacky, but should not 
            be sticking to your counter top.  After about 3 minutes, the dough 
            should be smooth, slightly elastic, and tacky. Lightly grease 
            a large mixing bowl with olive oil, and place the dough into 
            the bowl.</li><br>
        <li>Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or plastic wrap) and allow 
            the dough to rise in a warm, dry area of your kitchen for 2 hours 
            or until the dough has doubled in size. <strong>Proofing Tip:</strong> 
            If your kitchen is very cold, heat a large heatproof measuring cup 
            of water in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. This creates a nice warm 
            environment. Remove the cup and place the bowl with the dough in 
            the microwave until it has risen. [If you are preparing the dough 
            in advance, see the note section for freezing instructions.]</li><br>
        <li><strong>Preheat Oven and Pizza Steel or Stone:</strong> Place the pizza steel (or 
            stone) on the second to top rack of your oven (roughly 8 inches 
            from the broiler element), and preheat the oven and steel 
            (or stone) to 550°F (285°C) for a minumum of 1 hour. If your 
            oven does not go up to 550°F (285°C) or you are using a delicate 
            pizza stone, I recommend heating it to a maximum of 500°F (260°C)</li><br>
        <li>As the oven is preheating, assemble the ingredients. In a small bowl, 
            stir together the pureed tomatoes, minced garlic, extra virgin olive 
            oil, pepper, and salt. Set aside another small bowl with the cubed 
            mozzarella cheese (pat the cheese with a paper towel to remove any 
            excess moisture). Set aside the basil leaves and grated 
            parmigiano-reggiano cheese for easy grabbing.</li><br>
        <li>Separate the dough into two equal-sized portions. It will deflate 
            slightly, but that is OK. Place the dough on a large plate or 
            floured counter top, cover gently with plastic wrap, and allow 
            the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong> Sprinkle the pizza peel (if you do not own a 
            pizza peel, you can try using the back of a half sheet pan - but 
            it is tricky!) with a tablespoon of semolina and dusting of 
            all-purpose flour. Gently use both hands to stretch one ball of 
            pizza dough into roughly a 10-inch circle (don’t worry if its not 
            perfectly uniform). If the dough springs back or is too elastic, 
            allow it to rest for an additional five minutes. The edges of the 
            dough can be slightly thicker, but make sure the center of the 
            dough is thin (you should be able to see some light through it if 
            you held it up). Gently transfer the dough onto the semolina and 
            flour dusted pizza peel or baking sheet.</li><br>
        <li>Drizzle or brush the dough lightly (using your fingertips) with 
            olive oil (roughly a teaspoon. Using a large spoon, add roughly 
            ½ cup of the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, leaving a ½-inch 
            or ¾-inch border on all sides. Use the back of the spoon to spread 
            it evenly and thinly. Sprinkle a tablespoon of parmigiano-reggiano 
            cheese onto the pizza sauce. Add half of the cubed mozzarella, 
            distributing it evenly over the entire pizza. Using your hands, 
            tear a few large basil leaves, and sprinkle the basil over the 
            pizza. At this point, I’ll occasionally stretch the sides of the 
            dough out a bit to make it even thinner. Gently slide the pizza 
            from the peel onto the heated baking stone. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, 
            or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and 
            caramelized and the edges of the pizza are golden brown. Note: 
            If you're looking for more color, finish the pizza under the low or 
            medium broil setting, but watch it carefully!</li><br>
        <li>Remove the pizza carefully from the oven with the pizza peel, 
            transfer to a wooden cutting board or foil, drizzle the top with 
            olive oil, some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and chiffonade 
            of fresh basil. Slice and serve immediately and/or prepare the 
            second pizza.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Serving Tip:</strong> If you’re serving two pizzas at once, I recommend 
            placing the cooked pizza on a separate baking sheet while you 
            prepare the other pizza. In the last few minutes of cooking, place 
            the prepared pizza into the oven (on a rack below the pizza stone) 
            so that it is extra hot for serving. Otherwise, I recommend 
            serving one pizza fresh out of the oven, keeping the oven hot, 
            and preparing the second pizza after people have gone through 
            the first one! The pizza will taste great either way, but it is 
            at its prime within minutes out of the oven!.</li>
